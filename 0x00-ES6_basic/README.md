ES6 Basics Curriculum

This curriculum is designed to introduce learners to the basics of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), the sixth edition of the JavaScript language specification. ES6 brings several new features and enhancements to JavaScript, empowering developers to write more concise and expressive code.
Overview

ES6 Basics is a short specialization consisting of twelve tasks aimed at familiarizing learners with key concepts and features introduced in ES6. Each task focuses on a specific aspect of ES6, such as variable declaration (const and let), block scope, arrow functions, default parameters, rest and spread syntax, template literals, object property shorthand, and ES6 method properties.
Learning Objectives

By completing this specialization, learners will be able to:

    Explain what ES6 is and its significance in JavaScript development.
    Understand and utilize new features introduced in ES6, such as const, let, arrow functions, default parameters, and template literals.
    Differentiate between const and let, and understand block-scoped variables.
    Implement functions using ES6's arrow function syntax.
    Use default parameter values and rest parameter syntax in functions.
    Employ spread syntax to manipulate arrays and strings.
    Utilize template literals for string interpolation.
    Implement object creation and property shorthand syntax in ES6.
    Understand and use ES6 method properties.
    Iterate over arrays using the for...of loop.

Prerequisites

    Basic understanding of JavaScript programming.
    Familiarity with fundamental programming concepts such as variables, functions, and loops.

Setup

To complete the tasks in this specialization, ensure you have the following:

    NodeJS 12.11.x installed on your machine.(create a symbolic link to node if nodejs is not found: sudo ln -s /usr/bin/node /usr/bin/nodejs)
    An editor such as Visual Studio Code or any other allowed editors (vi, vim, emacs).
    Knowledge of how to execute JavaScript files using NodeJS.
    Familiarity with using npm for managing dependencies.
    Run npm install to ensure that all the dependencies specified in your package.json file are installed.
    Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the linting and testing scripts defined in your package.json.
    To lint your JavaScript files, run npm run check-lint.
    To run your tests, run npm test.
    To run linting and tests together, run npm run full-test.

Tasks

Each task in this specialization corresponds to a specific concept or feature of ES6. Tasks include modifying code snippets, rewriting functions using ES6 syntax, and implementing new functionalities. Detailed instructions and execution examples are provided for each task.
Repository Structure

    Each task has its own directory within the GitHub repository alx-backend-javascript.
    Inside each task directory, you'll find the JavaScript file(s) corresponding to that task.
    Follow the instructions provided in the README.md file of each task directory to complete the task.
    Execute the provided main.js file to test your implementation for each task.

Conclusion

By completing the ES6 Basics specialization, you'll gain a solid foundation in ES6 syntax and features, enabling you to write more modern and efficient JavaScript code. These skills are essential for any JavaScript developer looking to stay current with the latest advancements in the language. Happy coding!
