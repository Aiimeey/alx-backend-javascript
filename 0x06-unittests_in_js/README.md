Unit Tests in JavaScript
Overview

This project focuses on mastering unit testing for Node.js applications using Mocha, Chai, and Sinon. The tasks cover a range of testing techniques including basic assertions, spies, stubs, hooks, async testing, and integration testing. The project culminates in setting up a small Express server and performing integration testing to ensure the server's functionality.
Project Structure

The project is organized into several tasks, each with specific requirements and objectives. Here's a breakdown:
Tasks

    Basic Test with Mocha and Node Assertion Library
        Implement a function to perform simple arithmetic operations and test it using Mocha with Node's assert library.

    Combining Descriptions
        Extend the function to handle different types of arithmetic operations and organize tests using describe.

    Basic Test Using Chai Assertion Library
        Convert tests to use Chai's expect style for a more readable and behavior-driven development approach.

    Spies
        Utilize Sinon to create spies to monitor function calls and validate interactions.

    Stubs
        Replace actual function implementations with stubs to control and test specific behaviors without executing real code.

    Hooks
        Use Mocha's hooks (beforeEach and afterEach) to set up and tear down test conditions.

    Async Tests with Done
        Write tests for asynchronous functions using Mocha's done callback to handle asynchronous operations correctly.

    Skip Tests
        Demonstrate how to skip failing tests while ensuring the rest of the test suite continues to run.

    Basic Integration Testing
        Set up an Express server and write integration tests to verify server responses and status codes.

    Regex Integration Testing & Post Integration Testing
        Add new endpoints to the Express server and test them, including checking deep equality of objects and handling POST requests.

Getting Started

    Clone the Repository

    sh

git clone https://github.com/<username>/alx-backend-javascript.git
cd alx-backend-javascript/0x06-unittests_in_js

Install Dependencies

sh

npm install

Run Tests

Each task contains its own set of test files. To run tests for a specific task, use:

sh

npm test <test-file>

For example:

sh

    npm test 0-calcul.test.js

Files

    0-calcul.js / 0-calcul.test.js: Basic arithmetic function and tests.
    1-calcul.js / 1-calcul.test.js: Extended function with operation type and tests.
    2-calcul_chai.js / 2-calcul_chai.test.js: Chai-based tests.
    3-payment.js / 3-payment.test.js: Tests using Sinon spies.
    4-payment.js / 4-payment.test.js: Tests using Sinon stubs.
    5-payment.js / 5-payment.test.js: Tests using Mocha hooks.
    6-payment_token.js / 6-payment_token.test.js: Async tests with done.
    7-skip.test.js: Demonstration of skipping tests.
    8-api/api.js / 8-api/api.test.js: Basic integration testing with Express.
    9-api/api.js / 9-api/api.test.js: Regex-based integration testing.
    10-api/api.js / 10-api/api.test.js: Deep equality and POST integration testing.

Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be proficient in:

    Writing and organizing test suites with Mocha and Chai.
    Utilizing Sinon for spies and stubs.
    Implementing hooks for setup and teardown in tests.
    Handling async functions and ensuring proper test execution.
    Performing integration testing with Express and validating server responses.
